# bigben

index.html is a webpage that will display the clock face of Big Ben (using the current
local time) and, optionally, play ticks and/or the appropriate chimes.
You can access the webpage at https://heffalump.mit.edu/bigben or clone the repo and
access `file://...repodir.../index.html`.

I like to view this page in a background tab of my always-open browser, setting the volumes
so as to simulate having a grandfather clock in a neighboring room.
